# Exporting Your Project to GitHub

Since Git isn't directly available in this environment, follow these steps to export your project to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "python-script-admin")
4. Add an optional description
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Download Your Project Files

1. In the StackBlitz environment, click on the "Project" tab in the left sidebar
2. Click on the "Download Project" button (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
3. This will download a ZIP file of your entire project to your local machine

## Step 3: Upload to GitHub

### Option 1: Using GitHub's Web Interface (for smaller projects)

1. On your new GitHub repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Extract the ZIP file you downloaded to a folder on your computer
3. Drag and drop the files from the extracted folder to the GitHub upload area
4. Add a commit message like "Initial commit"
5. Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Using Git on Your Local Machine (recommended)

1. Extract the ZIP file you downloaded to a folder on your computer
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the extracted folder:
   ```
   cd path/to/extracted/folder
   ```
4. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```
5. Add all files to the repository:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
6. Commit the files:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
7. Add your GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```
8. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (Note: If you're using an older version of Git, you might need to use `master` instead of `main`)

## Step 4: Verify Your Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your project files listed

## Additional Information

- If you make changes to your project in StackBlitz, you'll need to download the updated files and push them to GitHub again
- Consider adding a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files like `node_modules` and build artifacts
- You might want to add a README.md file to provide information about your project

## GitHub Actions (Optional)

If you want to set up automatic deployment to Netlify from GitHub:

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
4. Select your repository
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
6. Click "Deploy site"

This will set up continuous deployment so that any changes pushed to your GitHub repository will automatically be deployed to Netlify.
